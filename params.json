{"name":"Gesture physio","tagline":"Gesture Physio is a physical rehabilitation assessment tool, for recording and storing range of motion readings in rotator cuff injury evaluation. The software utilizes Thalmic Lab's \"Myo\" gestural control arm band to gather ROM readings.","body":"### Welcome to the Gesture Physio project page.\r\n\r\nGesture Physio aims to address the issue of manually measuring and recording range of motion readings from a patient. In practice, a physiotherapist will use a protractor like tool called a gonio meter to measure range of motion readings from a patient. This process in practice proves cumbersome for the physiotherapist, due to the length of time needed to take the measurements and record them. \r\n\r\n\"Gesture Physio\"  aims to overcome these issues by providing a software suite that will interface with a motion and gesture sensor, to enable quick and effective evaluation of range of motion readings.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Project Demo:\r\n\r\n[Gesture Physio Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yv-qzR0LbPM)\r\n\r\n### Contributing Libraries\r\n* MyoSharp (@tayfuzun)\r\n* High-Charts (@highslide-software)\r\n* Gu.Gauges (@JohanLarsson) \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving any questions on this Gesture Physio?
